# 🎓 Student Stress Monitoring & Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **data analytics and machine learning** to identify, predict, and explain student stress levels using behavioral, academic, psychological, and environmental data.

The goal is not just prediction, but **actionable decision support** — enabling institutions to **detect at-risk students early**, design **targeted interventions**, and improve overall student wellbeing and academic outcomes.

This project simulates a **real-world education analytics / public health use case**.

---

## 🧠 Business / Institutional Problem
Educational institutions often struggle to:
- Detect student stress early
- Understand *why* stress occurs
- Allocate mental health resources effectively
- Balance academic performance with wellbeing

Stress is usually identified **too late**, after academic decline or mental health crises.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Predict high-stress students using data-driven models
- Identify the **key drivers of stress**
- Segment students into **intervention-ready groups**
- Translate analytics into **clear, operational recommendations**
- Support **policy, academic, and mental health decisions**

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Total students analyzed:** 1,100  
- **High-stress students:** 369 (33.5%)  
- **Students with mental health history:** 542  
- **Average stress level:** 1.00  

Data includes:
- Psychological factors (anxiety, depression, self-esteem)
- Academic performance
- Sleep quality
- Bullying exposure
- Environmental stressors
- Mental health history

## 🔍 Key Analytical Insights

### 📈 Strongest Drivers of Stress
| Feature | Correlation |
|------|------------|
| Self-esteem | 0.756 |
| Bullying exposure | 0.751 |
| Sleep quality | 0.749 |
| Career uncertainty | 0.743 |
| Anxiety level | 0.737 |

**Key Insight:**  
Stress is driven primarily by **psychosocial and lifestyle factors**, not academics alone — highlighting the need for **holistic interventions**.

## 📊 Analysis Visualizations (Python)
